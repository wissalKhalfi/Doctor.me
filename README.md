# Doctor.me

Often, individuals who need to be monitored in hospitals have to spend a lot of money and waste their valuable time. 
It is time consuming and very expensive.
To help solve this problem, we conceived “Doctor.me”.
“Doctor.me” is a multiplatform solution, that is conceived to help users and their doctors monitor their health status whenever 
and wherever they want.
7 sensors are connected to a portable shield, that sends instant data to a distant server, to be analysed and used in a third party, 
which is mobile and web applications.
The web application is designed to be used only by the doctors: when a doctor registers, he can consult all his registered patients, 
check their health status and sensors behaviour through real-time charts. He has the ability of adding new patients too.
As for the mobile application, it is available on IOS and Android operating devices. Designed to be used by both patients and the doctors,
it encompasses many features of the proposed solution.
Once the doctor logs in, he has access to the dashboard where he can display all his patients, their information, 
sensors status and values, their treatments, and notes.
He can also add or delete treatments or notes.
The doctor is allowed to also to manage his appointments: either decline or approve it.
As for the patient, on mobile, he’s allowed to monitor his health status, check the notes written by the doctor and the prescript treatment. He can also ask for an appointment.
